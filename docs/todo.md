# Ideas:

- Whitenova's graph with horizontal scroll
- All responses are individual blocks
- Blocks are collapsable
- Blocks can exported (pdf?)
- User autocompletion:
```
You can use range[login]=bde,bdezzzzz to find logins beginning with bde
Some logins contain numbers, it will also get them (see range[login]=yki,ykizzzzz)
```
